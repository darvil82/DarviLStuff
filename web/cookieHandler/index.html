	<h1>Cookies Handling</h1>
	<p>
		If you ever worked with Cookies, you may know that it is pretty ugly.
		At that time when they added Cookies, they thought that using a "string" as a
		way to add cookies was not confusing at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's understandable that Cookies are very old now, but the system for handling these
		could be improved without breaking backwards compatibility, like implementing a simple
		Cookie object that can be used to handle them easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		So that's what I did (and what many, many millions of people probably already done).
	</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<code>
		const cookies = new Cookies()
		cookies.set({ user: { name: "Aster", age: 21 } })
	</code>
	<p>
		This will add a new cookie with that object. Of course, this object will be
		converted into an stringified JSON.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only objects can be used. Pretty much any value can be saved.
		It is also possible to supply options for the cookie, like its expire date,
		path, etc...
	</p>
	<h2>Getting the cookie value</h2>
	<p>
		After that, in order to get the value:
	</p>
	<code>
		cookies.get("user")
	</code>
	<p>
		This will return the original object.
	</p>
	<h2>Deleting cookies</h2>
	<p>
		In order to remove a cookie, you just need to:
	</p>
	<code>
		cookies.remove("user")
	</code>
	<h2>Try it out!</h2>
	<p>
		The script has been included in this html, so feel free to try this
		by just opening the console.
	</p>
	<h1>Using it</h1>
	<p>
		Wanna use it on your site? If that's the case (thank you) you can just include it like this:
	</p>
	<code>
		&lt;script src="https://darvil82.github.io/DarviLStuff/web/cookieHandler/cookies.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	</code>
